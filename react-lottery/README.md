# React-Lottery

Simple SPA to create an Etheruem Lottery Smart Contract.

Allows users (players) to enter the lottery by specifiying the amount of Ether to enter and clicking on the enter button.

The manager (admin user) can then choose a winner by selecting the 'Pick a winner' button. The chosen winner will then be deposited with the Ether.

The project was generated with react-create-app.

## Libraries/Tech used:

- React,
- Web3,
- Metamask (for interface with digital wallets), for testing purposes I used the Ropsten Etheruem Test Network and used a Faucet to generate test Ether,
- Copy of a previously created Smart Contract on the blockchain.
